This is a quick and easy one page solution for calculating resources required to build structure
and equipment load-outs in ASTRONEER. Simply select the items you need from the appropriate printer column, and
select ADD to list. Increase the quantity of items in the list. Download the materials list, or just
keep the page open in your browser. 
Persistance Note: I am using the IndexedDB API, so in a 'regular' browser window/tab (not Incognito/InPrivate) your
data will survive tab/browser closure, restarts, even session purge. It will not survive scheduled or manual Cookie purges.
